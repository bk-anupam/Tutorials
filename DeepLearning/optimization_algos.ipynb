    "### **Why Do Noisy Features Have Large Parameter Values?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "When a machine learning model learns from data, it assigns **parameter values (weights)** to different features based on their influence on the target variable. **Noisy features**, which are **random and uninformative**, can still receive **large weights** under certain conditions, especially when regularization is absent. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Noisy Features Have No True Pattern, So the Model \"Compensates\"**\n",
    "- A **useful feature** has a strong, consistent relationship with the target, so the model assigns a reasonable weight.  \n",
    "- A **noisy feature**, on the other hand, has **random fluctuations**, meaning its effect on the target is **inconsistent** across samples.  \n",
    "- Since the model still tries to fit the training data as accurately as possible, it **forces large weight values** onto noisy features to adjust for these random variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**  \n",
    "Imagine we are predicting house prices, and we mistakenly include a **random customer ID** as a feature.  \n",
    "- This ID has **no real relationship** with the price, but because it is **random**, it might **accidentally** correlate with prices in the training set.  \n",
    "- The model **memorizes** these random correlations and assigns **large weight values** to fit the noise perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Lack of Regularization Allows Large Weights**\n",
    "Regularization techniques like **L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge)** **penalize** large weights, preventing noise-driven weight inflation. However, **without regularization**:\n",
    "- The model is free to assign **arbitrarily large** weights to noisy features.  \n",
    "- This leads to **overfitting**, where the model performs well on training data but generalizes poorly to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Perspective (Effect of L2 Regularization)**\n",
    "Without L2 regularization, the loss function (Mean Squared Error, for example) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L = \\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With L2 regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L = \\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 + \\lambda \\sum w_j^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The additional term $\\lambda \\sum w_j^2$ discourages large weight values.\n",
    "- **Without it, weights can grow excessively, even for noisy features.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. High Model Complexity Enables Memorization of Noise**\n",
    "- A simple linear model with few parameters cannot easily memorize noise.\n",
    "- But **high-capacity models** (e.g., deep neural networks, large decision trees) have enough flexibility to **assign large weights to random features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example in Neural Networks**\n",
    "- In a **deep learning model**, each weight update during training minimizes the loss.\n",
    "- If noise in the dataset **accidentally reduces the loss**, the optimizer assigns **higher weight values** to noisy features.\n",
    "- Without regularization or dropout, noisy weights grow **disproportionately large**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Noisy Features Have High Variance, Which Leads to Large Weights**\n",
    "- **Good features** have stable, consistent effects on predictions → Model assigns moderate weight values.\n",
    "- **Noisy features** have **high variance**, meaning their effects fluctuate randomly.\n",
    "- The model **inflates weight values** to adjust for these fluctuations, mistakenly treating them as important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of Variance Inflation**\n",
    "Suppose a dataset contains a **spurious feature** (e.g., random stock market noise in predicting house prices).\n",
    "- If some random fluctuations **align with** the training labels, the model gives them **high importance**.\n",
    "- Large weights **amplify variance**, leading to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. What Does Model Sensitivity Mean?**\n",
    "### **(A) Sensitivity to Input Variations**  \n",
    "- A **sensitive model** reacts **strongly** to small changes in input data.\n",
    "- A **robust model** maintains stable predictions despite minor input variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- **High Sensitivity:** A neural network trained without regularization changes predictions drastically if input values slightly shift.  \n",
    "- **Low Sensitivity (Robust Model):** A well-regularized model makes consistent predictions even when inputs contain small noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(B) Sensitivity to Noise & Overfitting**  \n",
    "- A highly sensitive model will capture **noise**, leading to **overfitting**.\n",
    "- Reducing sensitivity (via **regularization, dropout, or data augmentation**) improves **generalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Why Regularization Prevents Noise from Becoming a Feature**  \n",
    "Regularization techniques such as **L1, L2, and dropout** help prevent models from learning noise by:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(A) L1 Regularization (Lasso) – Feature Selection**  \n",
    "- Shrinks some feature weights to **zero**, effectively **removing unimportant features**.  \n",
    "- Noise-related features will likely be **discarded**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(B) L2 Regularization (Ridge) – Penalizing Large Weights**  \n",
    "- Reduces overfitting by **shrinking weights**, preventing the model from assigning **high importance to noisy features**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(C) Dropout – Random Neuron Deactivation**  \n",
    "- Prevents memorization by forcing the network to learn **redundant representations** that generalize well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(D) Early Stopping – Preventing Overtraining**  \n",
    "- Stops training **before** the model starts capturing noise.\n",
    "- Helps maintain **generalization** by halting training when validation loss starts increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Conclusion**\n",
    "- **Noisy features receive large parameter values** because the model tries to compensate for their randomness.\n",
    "- **Lack of regularization** allows noisy weights to grow excessively.\n",
    "- **High model complexity** enables memorization of noise, further amplifying weight values.\n",
    "- **High variance in noisy features** forces the model to assign large weights to minimize training loss.\n",

    "### **Exponential Weighted Average (EWA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential Weighted Average (EWA) is a technique used to compute a weighted average of a sequence of values, where more recent values receive higher weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly used in:\n",
    "- **Time series analysis** and **signal processing** to emphasize recent trends.\n",
    "- **Smoothing noisy or fluctuating data**, such as stock prices or temperature readings.\n",
    "- **Capturing underlying patterns** in sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formula for EWA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The EWA at time step **t** is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_t = \\beta \\cdot V_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta) \\cdot X_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ X_t $ = Observed value at time step **t**.\n",
    "- $ \\beta $ = Smoothing factor (also called weight or decay factor), where $ 0 < \\beta < 1 $.\n",
    "- $ V_t $ = Exponential weighted average at time **t**.\n",
    "- $ V_{t-1} $ = EWA from the previous time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Effect of β (Smoothing Factor)**\n",
    "The choice of $ \\beta $ affects how quickly the EWA adapts to changes in the data:\n",
    "- **Higher $ \\beta $ (e.g., 0.98)** → Gives more weight to past values, making the EWA smoother (averages over a larger number of previous values).\n",
    "- **Lower $ \\beta $ (e.g., 0.5)** → Reacts faster to new values but retains less memory of past values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximate number of past entries considered in EWA:\n",

    "| 0.9        | Last 10 entries             |\n",
    "| 0.98       | Last 50 entries             |\n",
    "| 0.5        | Last 2 entries              |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Initialization Bias**\n",
    "At the start, **$ V_0 $** is often initialized to **0**, leading to an early bias where initial values are underestimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To correct this, a **bias-corrected** version of EWA is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{V}_t = \\frac{V_t}{1 - \\beta^t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This correction helps make the early values more representative of the true moving average. As t increases, the bias correction term approaches 1, and the correction becomes negligible. This ensures bias correction is only significant for early values when bias is most pronounced and diminishes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- EWA is useful for tracking trends while reducing the effect of noise.\n",
    "- A **higher $ \\beta $** smooths data over a longer period, making it slower to respond to changes.\n",
    "- A **lower $ \\beta $** makes EWA more responsive to new values but less stable.\n",
    "- Bias correction ensures early values are not skewed by initialization.\n",

    "## Gradient Descent with Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent with Momentum is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a cost function. It enhances the standard Gradient Descent algorithm by addressing limitations such as slow convergence and oscillations around the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concept\n",
    "The core idea is to compute exponentially weighted averages for gradients and then update weights using these new values. This approach accelerates gradient descent in relevant directions, leading to faster convergence and reduced oscillations.\n",

    "1. **Faster Convergence:** Momentum speeds up gradient descent by helping the cost function reach its minimum more efficiently.\n",
    "2. **Reduced Oscillations:** The algorithm smooths out oscillations, especially in regions where gradients vary significantly in different directions.\n",
    "3. **Better Optimization in Deep Networks:** It is particularly beneficial for deep networks or large-scale datasets where standard gradient descent may struggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Hyperparameter `beta`\n",
    "- `beta` determines how much of the previous velocity is retained.\n",
    "- A common choice is `beta = 0.9`, which works well in most cases.\n",

    "### Mathematical Intuition\n",
    "To understand why momentum is effective, consider a **ball rolling down a hill**:\n",
    "- **Without Momentum:** The ball follows the slope exactly, which may cause it to oscillate in narrow valleys or get stuck in small pits.\n",
    "- **With Momentum:** The accumulated velocity allows the ball to roll smoothly, overcoming minor obstacles and accelerating towards the global minimum.\n",

    "\n",
    "Weight decay is a regularization technique used to reduce the magnitudes of the network's weights during training. It helps prevent **overfitting** by discouraging overly complex models that fit the noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematics of Weight Decay**:\n",
    "In optimizers like Adam and RMSProp, the learning rate can vary for each parameter. Weight decay works by subtracting a fraction of the weight values after computing the adaptive learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard weight decay formula is:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Here, the term $ (1 - \\text{lr} \\cdot wd) $ applies the weight decay to the weights, reducing them after each update.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **L2 Regularization** (A Special Case of Weight Decay)\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization is a specific type of weight decay where a penalty term is added to the loss function. This penalty term is proportional to the squared magnitudes of the weights, helping the model avoid large weights that can lead to overfitting.\n",
