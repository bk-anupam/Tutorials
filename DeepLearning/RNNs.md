# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) — The Basics

A tutorial covering the core mechanics of a vanilla RNN: notation, the forward pass, the RNN cell, and the loss function.

## 1. Notation

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $T_x$ | Length of the input sequence |
| $T_y$ | Length of the output sequence |
| $x^{\langle i \rangle \langle t \rangle}$ | Input at time step $t$, for training example $i$ |
| $y^{\langle i \rangle \langle t \rangle}$ | Output at time step $t$, for training example $i$ |
| $n_x$ | Dimension of the input $x$ |
| $n_h$ | Dimension of the hidden layer (hidden state) |
| $n_y$ | Dimension of the output $y$ |
| $a^{\langle t \rangle}$ | Hidden (activation) state at time step $t$ |
| $a_0$ | Initial hidden state — a vector of zeros |

### Weight matrices

An RNN cell has three weight matrices:

- $a^{\langle t-1 \rangle}$ — shape $(n_h, 1)$ — previous hidden state
- $x^{\langle t \rangle}$ — shape $(n_x, 1)$ — current input
- $y^{\langle t \rangle}$ — shape $(n_y, 1)$ — output at the current time step
- $W_{aa}$ — shape $(n_h, n_h)$ — maps the previous hidden state to the new one
- $W_{ax}$ — shape $(n_h, n_x)$ — maps the current input to the hidden state
- $W_{ya}$ — shape $(n_y, n_h)$ — maps the hidden state to the output

**Stacking trick:** $W_{aa}$ and $W_{ax}$ are usually combined into a single matrix $W_a$ for efficiency:

$$
W_a = \big[\,W_{aa} \;\; W_{ax}\,\big] \quad \text{(horizontal stacking)}, \quad \text{shape } (n_h,\; n_h + n_x)
$$

This is paired with **vertical stacking** of the previous hidden state and current input into one column vector:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} a^{\langle t-1 \rangle} \\ x^{\langle t \rangle} \end{bmatrix}
$$

So instead of computing two matrix multiplications ($W_{aa}a^{\langle t-1\rangle}$ and $W_{ax}x^{\langle t\rangle}$) and adding them, you do **one** matrix multiplication (a dot product) against the stacked vector — same result, tidier computation.

## 2. The RNN Cell

At every time step, the RNN cell does one simple thing: it takes the **hidden state carried over from the previous step** and the **input at the current step**, concatenates them, and pushes them through a fully-connected layer with a `tanh` activation to produce the new hidden state.

```
                          ŷ⟨t⟩  (prediction)
                            ↑
                        [ softmax ]
                            ↑
              ┌─────────────────────────┐
   a⟨t-1⟩ ───▶│                         │───▶ a⟨t⟩
              │   concat → tanh( · )    │      │
    x⟨t⟩  ───▶│                         │      │  (also passed to
              └─────────────────────────┘      │   next time step)
                                                ▼
                                            next RNN cell
```

**In words:** the hidden state of the previous time step $a^{\langle t-1 \rangle}$ and the input of the current time step $x^{\langle t \rangle}$ are **concatenated** and fed into a fully-connected (FC) layer with a `tanh` activation function.

### Unrolled across time

Drawing the *same* cell repeated across time steps (it's the same weights reused, not different cells) shows how information flows forward through the sequence:

```
a₀ ──▶ [RNN cell] ──▶ a⟨1⟩ ──▶ [RNN cell] ──▶ a⟨2⟩ ──▶ [RNN cell] ──▶ a⟨3⟩ ──▶ ...
          ▲                       ▲                       ▲
          │                       │                       │
        x⟨1⟩                    x⟨2⟩                    x⟨3⟩
          │                       │                       │
          ▼                       ▼                       ▼
        ŷ⟨1⟩                    ŷ⟨2⟩                    ŷ⟨3⟩
```

Each cell shares the **same** $W_{aa}$, $W_{ax}$, $W_{ya}$ (and biases) — the weights don't change across time steps, only the inputs and hidden state do.

## 3. The Forward Pass — Equations

**Step 1 — Compute the new hidden state:**

$$
a^{\langle t \rangle} = g_1\Big(W_{aa}\,a^{\langle t-1 \rangle} + W_{ax}\,x^{\langle t \rangle} + b_a\Big)
$$

Using the stacked-matrix trick from Section 1, this is equivalent to:

$$
a^{\langle t \rangle} = g_1\Big(W_a\big[a^{\langle t-1 \rangle},\, x^{\langle t \rangle}\big] + b_a\Big)
$$

where $\big[a^{\langle t-1 \rangle}, x^{\langle t \rangle}\big]$ is the vertical stacking described above, and the whole expression is one dot product.

**Step 2 — Compute the prediction:**

$$
\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle} = g_2\Big(W_{ya}\,a^{\langle t \rangle} + b_y\Big)
$$

**Choice of activations:**
- $g_1$ = `tanh` (almost always, for the hidden state)
- $g_2$ = `sigmoid` (binary output) or `softmax` (multi-class output)

**Where each matrix's shape comes from:**
- $W_{aa}$ corresponds to the **input type** feeding into the hidden state
- $W_{ya}$ corresponds to the **output type** produced from the hidden state

## 4. Loss Function

For a single time step, using binary cross-entropy:

$$
\mathcal{L}^{\langle t \rangle}\big(\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}, y^{\langle t \rangle}\big) = -y^{\langle t \rangle}\log \hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle} - \big(1 - y^{\langle t \rangle}\big)\log\big(1 - \hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}\big)
$$

The **total loss** for a sequence is just the sum of the per-time-step losses:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{t=1}^{T_y} \mathcal{L}^{\langle t \rangle}\big(\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}, y^{\langle t \rangle}\big)
$$

This total loss is what gets backpropagated through time (BPTT) to update $W_{aa}$, $W_{ax}$, $W_{ya}$, $b_a$, and $b_y$.

## 5. Quick Recap

1. Initialize $a_0$ as a vector of zeros.
2. At each time step $t$: concatenate $a^{\langle t-1\rangle}$ and $x^{\langle t\rangle}$, pass through a `tanh`-activated FC layer to get $a^{\langle t\rangle}$.
3. Pass $a^{\langle t\rangle}$ through a `softmax`/`sigmoid` layer to get the prediction $\hat{y}^{\langle t\rangle}$.
4. Repeat for every time step, reusing the **same** weights.
5. Sum the per-step losses to get the total sequence loss, and backpropagate through time.

**Key limitation to keep in mind:** because the same small set of weights is reused across many time steps, plain RNNs like this one struggle with long sequences — gradients tend to vanish or explode. This is the motivation for gated variants like GRUs and LSTMs, which add mechanisms to control what information is kept or forgotten over long sequences.
