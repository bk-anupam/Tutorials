    "Intuitively, this definition means that multiplying A by the vector v results in a new vector\n",
    "that points in the same direction as v, but scaled by a factor $\\lambda$. If the eigenvalue is greater than one, the corresponding Avᵢ will expand. If it is smaller than one, it will shrink.\n",

    "Also note that for any eigenvector x ∈ $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, and scalar c ∈ $\\mathbb{C}$,  A(cx) = cAx = cλx = λ(cx), so cx is also an eigenvector. For this reason when we talk about “the” eigenvector associated with λ, we usually assume that the eigenvector is normalized to have length 1\n",

    "#### Conditions for Existence of Eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Square Matrix**:\n",
    "   - Only square matrices (i.e., matrices with the same number of rows and columns) can have eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Thus, $\\mathbf{A}$ must be an $n \\times n$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Characteristic Polynomial**:\n",
    "   - The eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$ are the roots of the characteristic polynomial, which is obtained from the characteristic equation:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\text{det}(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. The matrix $\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}$ is called the characteristic matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Non-Trivial Solution**:\n",
    "   - For $\\mathbf{v}$ to be an eigenvector, the equation $(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$ must have a non-trivial solution (i.e., $\\mathbf{v} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$). This requires that $\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}$ is singular (non-invertible), meaning its determinant is zero:\n",

    "     \\text{det}(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Existence of Eigenvalues**:\n",
    "   - If the characteristic polynomial has at least one real or complex root, then $\\mathbf{A}$ has at least one eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector. This is guaranteed for any square matrix because every polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ roots in the complex number system (including multiplicities), according to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Diagonalizability**:\n",
    "   - A matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is diagonalizable if there are $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors. This means $\\mathbf{A}$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{P}^{-1}\n",
    "     $$\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Properties Related to Eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Distinct Eigenvalues**:\n",
    "   - If a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ has $n$ distinct eigenvalues, then it has $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors, and hence it is diagonalizable. Eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Geometric Multiplicity**:\n",
    "   - The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is the dimension of its eigenspace (the set of all eigenvectors corresponding to $\\lambda$, along with the zero vector). This is always less than or equal to the algebraic multiplicity (the number of times $\\lambda$ appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Symmetric Matrices**:\n",
    "   - A symmetric matrix (i.e., $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{A}^\\top$) always has real eigenvalues and is always diagonalizable. The eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Determinant and Trace**:\n",
    "   - The determinant of a square matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is the product of its eigenvalues:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - The trace of a square matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is the sum of its eigenvalues:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Eigenvalues of Inverse**:\n",
    "   - If $\\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\text{If } \\lambda \\text{ is an eigenvalue of } \\mathbf{A}, \\text{ then } \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\text{ is an eigenvalue of } \\mathbf{A}^{-1}\n",
