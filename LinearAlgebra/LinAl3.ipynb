    "### Vector Subspace <a id=\"vector_subspace\"></a>\n",
    "A vector subspace (often simply called a subspace) is a collection of vectors within a vector space that satisfies specific closure properties under vector addition and scalar multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closure under vector addition: If u and v are in the subspace, then their sum (u + v) must also be in the subspace.\n",
    "Closure under scalar multiplication: If u is in the subspace and c is a scalar (real or complex number), then cu must also be in the subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basis of a Subspace:** A basis for a subspace ùëä is a set of vectors in ùëä that are linearly independent and span  ùëä. This means any vector in ùëä can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors, and there are no redundant vectors in the basis set.\n",
    "- **Dimension:** The dimension of the subspace ùëä, denoted as dim(ùëä), is the number of vectors in any basis for ùëä.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Dimension Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimension of a subspace provides valuable information about its structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A dimension of zero (dim(V) = 0) indicates the subspace only contains the zero vector.\n",
    "- A dimension of one (dim(V) = 1) represents a line passing through the origin.\n",
    "- A dimension of two (dim(V) = 2) signifies a plane through the origin in 3D space or a line in 2D space.\n",
    "- Higher dimensions refer to hyperplanes or even more complex geometric objects in higher-dimensional spaces."

    "### Row Space <a id=\"row_space\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **row space** of a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, denoted as $\\text{Row}(\\mathbf{A})$, is the set of all possible linear combinations of the row vectors of $\\mathbf{A}$. Row space of matrix A = Range($\\mathbf{A}^\\top$).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: For an $m \\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, the row space is the subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ spanned by the rows of $\\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Properties of the Row Space </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subspace**:\n",
    "   - The row space of $\\mathbf{A}$ is a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This means it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dimension**:\n",
    "   - The dimension of the row space of $\\mathbf{A}$ is called the **row rank** of $\\mathbf{A}$. It is equal to the maximum number of linearly independent row vectors in $\\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Row Rank Equals Column Rank**:\n",
    "   - The row rank of a matrix is equal to its column rank (the dimension of the column space). This common value is referred to simply as the **rank** of the matrix. Thus:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\text{dim}(\\text{Row}(\\mathbf{A})) = \\text{dim}(\\text{Col}(\\mathbf{A}))\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Basis of the Row Space**:\n",
    "   - A basis for the row space of $\\mathbf{A}$ can be found by selecting the linearly independent rows of $\\mathbf{A}$. Typically, these are the non-zero rows of $\\mathbf{A}$ in its row echelon form (REF) or reduced row echelon form (RREF).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Row Operations**:\n",
    "   - Elementary row operations (row swaps, row scaling, and adding multiples of one row to another) do not change the row space of $\\mathbf{A}$. However, they can be used to simplify $\\mathbf{A}$ to find a basis for the row space more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Orthogonality**:\n",
    "   - The row space of $\\mathbf{A}$ is orthogonal to the null space of $\\mathbf{A}$. This means that any vector in the row space is orthogonal to any vector in the null space.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Transformation Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - If $\\mathbf{A}$ is viewed as a linear transformation from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}^m$, the row space of $\\mathbf{A}$ corresponds to the space of all possible linear combinations of the input vectors that map to the rows of $\\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Example </u>\n",

    "Consider the matrix:\n",
